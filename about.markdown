# Who is Anak Wannaphaschaiyong? 

I am currently doing Phd at Florida Atlantic University (FAU).
My area of study is deep learning.

# What is this blog about?

The Purposed on the this blog is to consolidate [[concept]] from [[page]] in my curated
[[notes]] from bullet point  to an eassy format.
In the otherwords, I narrated knowledge from my second brain storage into a collection of blog.

* note
    * all articles will be later moved into this blog. I am in the processed of migrating my
        article from medium to this blog

# How to read this blog?
I follow the learning approach that I named [[categorize-then-synthesize]].
"categorized-then-synthesize" is 2 steps learning technique where the first step of learning is to focusing 
on capturing ideas and categorized them into [[concepts]] before trying to fully understand what have been
learned.

This approach allows me to "pipeline" my well categorized concepts into different forms including the
following. (I called it [[learning pipeline]])
* [[notes]]
* research paper
* blogs 
* experiments logs

I have follow the same syntax for naming things. I used this not only for this blog, but for all the
information can be compressed into [[concepts]].
By now, readers should notice that I have used [[]] alot in my writing, and there is a reason for it.
[[]] is a [[concepts]] that I have categorized to satisfy certain properties that my [[notes]] have to obey,
and all of the words inside of [[]] can be found in my [[Garun]]:LifeLongCuratedNotes Project. 
(I need a name so when people refers to this idea, they have a [[concepts]] to hang on to as a mean of
communication.

Both [[Garun]] and this blog are part of the my learning pipelines that is movtivated by "automation" which is
one of my life principle.

# Why did I started this blog?
I comes to figure out that I am motivation by the concept of "automation" which I have later adopted as one of
the core part of my life principle where my thought and actions evolve around.

Automation is the I idea that drive me to work really hard at the moment, if I know that I don't have to do it
again in the furture.

This blog is part of my [[learning pipeline]].

# What is my life goals?
As I stated earlier that my action,thought, and plan are bounded by my life principles.
I first discover idea of Principle from Ray Dalio's book named "Principles of Life and Work."

1. I want to one day becomes "digital nomad"
2. whatever I decided to do to make money, I want to be able to stick with it for the rest of my life.
* This required me to only focus on work that have can be scaled and automate everything that can make be money. 
An example is to automate such that I am more productive, so I have more time to explore ways to make money.
3. I want to be able to do work related things that only required 1 laptop. No papers needed. 
(I also really hate using mouse when working.) 
4. My works should not be depended to location. 
5. When collaborate with a team, my work efficiency should be independent of location and time of day.
6. I want to automate everything that satisfy my life principle, learn more, experience more, richer.
