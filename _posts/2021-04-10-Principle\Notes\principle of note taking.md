# Content
* How to write [[notes]]?
    * each [[page]] in a note should be question oriented.
        * user of the notes should be able to search for answer with combination of syntax that 
            should bring the user to the answers.
        * common questions will have a "syntax" representation.
            * using syntax to represent common question satify searchability of note's properties.
            * example of common questions and its syntax representation.
                * Reference     => "What are the info sources related to X?"
                * Definition    => "What is X?"
                * Properties    => "What is the properties of X?"
                * Story/History => WHO/WHEN/ question about X
                * UseCase       => "How is X used?"
                * Compare       => "What is the differences between X and Y?"
                * FAQS          => Note a question about q but often asked when learning about X.
    * organized concept by using [[bullet point]]
* what is the benefit of writing notes in this way?
    * benefit other than notes properties are as followed.
        * this note taking process allowed you to apply 'pause and learn' strategy
            * [[page]]'s self-contained properties implies that after reading the page 
                any reader will come to the following conclusion
                1. understand info about the page 
                2. acknowledge that there is a knowledge gap that needs to be filled before the page
                    can be fully understood
            * with the self-contained properties, one can "stop" the learning by formating the page
                such as future reader will be lead to the second conclusion of the knowledge gap.
                * note here that knowledge gap created here is not a knowledge gap between 
                    future reader and the page, instead, it is a knowledge gap between writer and 
                    the page.
                * Furthermore, page is organized in question oriented way which make the note modular
                    and easily extensiable.
        * simialr to page, self-conetained is also a property of [[bullet points]].
            * this allow concept to be easy move to around.
                * just cut and paste the bullet point.
                * this helps with extensibility properties of the notes.
